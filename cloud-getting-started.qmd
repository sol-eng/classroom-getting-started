## Setup

Ultimately, these are the steps to join the workshop environment. More details are below:

-   Create or Log Into your GitHub Account

-   Join the Workshop Space on RStudio Cloud

-   Log into your RStudio Cloud Account

### Create or Log Into Your GitHub Account

First, we need to log into [GitHub](https://github.com). If you do not have a GitHub account, you can visit <https://github.com/join/>.

### Join the Workshop Space on RStudio Cloud

Your instructor should provide a link to join the Workshop space on RStudio Cloud. This has several pre-installed packages and starter projects to make the workshop go a bit smoother.

When you visit this link, you will be asked to sign in:

### Log into your RStudio Cloud Account

If you have an existing account, use that to log in!

If not, use `Log In with GitHub`. You will be asked to let RStudio Cloud read your email address:

Once logged in, you will be asked to Join the Space:

This space will then be added to your available RStudio Cloud Spaces:

Now follow the instructor's directions for next steps in the workshop!

## Other Tasks

### Create a GitHub Repository

If you have never created a repository before, you can do that now! There is a "New Repository" button in the top right corner.

You need to choose a name, but GitHub also provides inspiration:

It can also be a good idea to "Add a README file" to explain your repository:

Once this is complete, the "git url" for your repository is what you will use to reference it from other locations (like the RStudio IDE, Jupyter, or other editor):

### Open a GitHub Repository in RStudio Cloud

To Open a GitHub Repository in RStudio Cloud, use the "New Project" drop-down and choose "New Project from Git Repository":

Enter the HTTPS URL of your GitHub repository:

Make sure that "Add packages from the base project" is checked so that you save time on installing packages!

The first deployment can sometimes take a little while! You are on your way to success!

### Publishing Workflow

To test publishing, click the blue "publish" button in the IDE. It shows up on publishable resources like Shiny Apps, RMarkdown reports, Quarto documents, etc.

Choose "RStudio Connect"

![](images/paste-517B79C6.png)

In the dialog, enter <https://rsc.training.rstudio.com> . This is an example RStudio Connect service maintained for the purpose of the workshop.

You will be asked to log in. **Use your GitHub Account**.

![](images/paste-ADBBFBBD.png)

Add whatever information you desire to the registration page. This information does not need to be filled out.

![](images/paste-F46D60B6.png)

Then you will be asked to connect your IDE to the RStudio Connect service:

![](images/paste-FAD1E8A4.png)

Back in the IDE, finish the account connection process by clicking "Connect Account:"

![](images/paste-840413A2.png)

Then you should be ready to publish!!

## Troubleshooting

If you run into trouble with an existing package (i.e. `rsconnect`), one possible solution is to reinstall the package:

    install.packages("rsconnect")

Otherwise feel free to reach out to your instructor or TA with questions!!
